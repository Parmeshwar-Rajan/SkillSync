# Introduction:

SkillSync is a web-based collaboration platform designed to help students across different universities in India find teammates, join hackathons, work on academic projects, and connect with peers who share similar skills and interests.
The platform provides verified student profiles, AI-based teammate recommendations, real-time collaboration tools, and event discovery, creating a unified space for students to network and innovate.

# Problem Statement:

Students often struggle to find teammates for hackathons or academic projects—especially when they wish to collaborate with people outside their own university.
There is no central platform where students from IITs, NITs, BITS, VIT, and other institutions can connect, verify their identity, share skills, and form diverse, interdisciplinary teams.
This leads to:
1) Difficulty finding skilled teammates
2) Limited exposure to cross-campus collaboration
3) Wasted time on messaging different groups/social media
4) Reduced opportunity for innovation
